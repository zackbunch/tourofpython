    "The REST (REpresentational State Transfer) architecture for network-based service access was devised by Roy Fielding, ",
    "who introduced it in his 2000 Ph.D. dissertation. ",
    "Before Fielding, standard APIs for network-based service access assumed the use of remote procedure call (RPC): ",
    "the use of network-aware procedure calls to blur the distinction between local and networked services. ",
    "Fielding argued that protocols for network-based service access must expose the challenges of networked communications to designers, ",
    "in order to allow for efficient approaches for addressing network-specific communications difficulties ",
    "such as server crashes, network latency, and limitations on communications bandwidth. \n",
    "\n",
    "Among its other features, Fielding’s architecture uses stateless communication as a means of simplifying crash recovery ",
    " and transparent, network-based caching of content as a means of reducing latency and conserving bandwidth. ",
    "\n",
    "As a basis for his architecture, Fielding defined HTTP, including the semantics of GET, PUT, and POST and the error codes for responding to problem requests.\n",
    "A RESTful API is one that meets Fielding’s five constraints for API interaction:\n",
    "- The API must provide client-server-style, request-response-based communications via HTTP.\n",
    "- Communications must be stateless: i.e., every request supplies all context needed to fulfill the request, ",
    "including (e.g.) proof of the requestor’s authority to make the request. ",
    "Statelessness simplifies server maintenance and crash recovery by eliminating the need for servers to restart dialogues following crashes.\n",
    "- Responses must be cacheable. This allows for the network to reduce communications latency by storing served content closer to its requestors.",
    " Users, however, must be wary of stale data.\n",
    "- The API must provide a uniform interface. This includes support for the ability to query an interface’s version and data formatting protocols.\n",
    "- The API must allow for a layered implementation. ",
    "This allows for the use of load balancers to distribute traffic or the addition of network-based security measures like gateways.\n",
    "\n",
