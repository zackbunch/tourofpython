    "Like other OO languages, Python supports encapsulation. ",

    "Unlike compiled OO languages, Python lacks support for strong data hiding. ",
    "Declarations like \"public\", \"private\" and \"protected\" are absent from Python. ",

    "Apart from a few built-in immutable classes and constants, all Python identifiers are always readable and updateable, ",
    "as are the objects they reference. The rationale for this lack of checking is threefold:\n",
    "-  Python's support for `eval` and `exec` renders any attempt to implement static access checking imperfect.\n",
    "-  Using run-time checks to enforce data hiding would slow every data access.  Most checks, moreover, would be useless and redundant.\n",
    "-  Treating data hiding as a convention rather than a requirement gives programmers freedom to break data hiding at need.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python does support one weak mechanism for data hiding.  This mechanism, *name mangling*, is invoked automatically for ",

    "-  converting all references to these attributes from within their container objects to these new names\n",

    "*Dependency inversion* refers to the structuring of a family of objects as objects with a single, common interface and varied implementations. ",
    "Type systems for compiled OO languages require that the common interface be defined as a base class, ",
    "then specialized for particular realizations of that interface. ",
    "A classic characterization of this approach posits \n",
    "-  an abstract base class (ABC) that returns a time of day, with \n",
    "-  a set of child classes that retrieve time-of-day information from different kinds of timepieces, \n",
    "   ranging from digital assistants to digital clocks to sundials.\n",
    "\n",
    "The term \"dependency inversion\" was coined at a time when object-oriented languages first came into vogue. ",
    "It was developed as an alternative to *run-time type inference* (RTTI):  a design strategy that uses a test of a value's type ",
    "at run time to select one of collection of routines to use to process that value. ",
    "The term *inversion* was used to signal a need to \"invert\" previous practice by designing an ABC before its child classes. \n",
    "\n",
    "RTTI is now viewed as a poor practice that hinders program evolution. ",
    "In RTTI-based codes, adding routines to or removing them from a given family of routines can force changes to *all* codes ",
    "that access *any* of these routines.  Dependency inversion, by contrast, ",
    "localizes such changes to the classes being added or removed, so long as those classes share the common interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "In interpreted languages, the lack of compile-time type checking eliminates the need to use a base class ",
    "in order to assure a child class's type is correct for where it's being used. ",
    "So long as an object has attributes that fit a given context, its type is assumed to be correct. ",
    "This approach to type checking is referred to as *latent* typing or *duck* typing: ",
    "i.e., if an object walks like a duck and quacks like a duck, assume it's a duck.\n",
    "\n",
    "Latent typing is favored by a minimalist school of software design, including authorities like Russ Olsen ",
    "(<u>Eloquent Ruby</u>) who argue for achieving software quality by writing concise programs with clearly named variables ",
    "and supporting them with carefully crafted regression test suites. ",
    "These authorities criticize type declarations and hard-coded type checks as syntactic clutter: ",
    "i.e., attempt to prevent potential errors that would be better prevented by careful naming and testing. ",
    "While these authorities recommend inheritance as a means of eliminating duplicate code, they see it as useless for defining types.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following examples use these additional Python constructs:\n",
    "- `ABCMeta` - a Python *metaclass* (see below) that prevents a class from being used to instantiate other classes; \n",
    "  the constrained class is similar to abstract base classes in compiled OO languages.\n",
    "-  `input` - read a string from the user's terminal\n",
    "-  `time.strftime` - display time of day as a string\n",
    "\n",
    "A *metaclass* is a class that controls the operation of a(nother) class. ",
    "  All Python classes have metaclasses: the default is `object`. ",
